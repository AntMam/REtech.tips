  bio: Using, building, and writing about real estate tech. I've been a real estate broker for over 7 years. After growing tired of the tools I used, I built my own and decided to share my experiences.

## Real Estate Tech Spans a Broad Range:

- Construction
- Management
- Business Operations
- Brokerage
- Retail
- Banking
- Climate / Energy
- Data

And within those fields, you can probably break down several sub-categories. 

The total value of US commercial real estate is estimated to be between [$14 and $17 trillion dollars](https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us), with [$307 billion in revenue for 2021](https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/real-estate/united-states). It makes sense that companies are racing to find solutions to the sector's problems.

__We all know COVID dominated 2020. Regardless, over $17 billion was poured into the space.__


## So what does this mean?

There are numerous amounts of companies out there now competing for a share of the crowded market.  I've used many of these technologies since I started my career in 2014. I feel lucky I learned from the traditional processes of brokerage and discovered the problems for myself. 

Traditional construction methods? - modular builds and 3D printing have entered the chat.

Phonebooks / directories? - they have been replaced by data providers and API's.

Physical maps? - they've went digital a while ago, with counties also offering their parcel data for free.

Paying $5,000 for 3D Models of your space? - LiDAR scanners have made their way into phones, you can create them on you own. 

The list goes on.
