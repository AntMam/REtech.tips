  bio: Using, building, and writing about real estate tech. I've been in the real estate business for over 7 years. After growing tired of the tools I used, I decided to learn more about technology and software development. Now I'd like to share the experiences I've made to help other real estate professionals and software developers in the field.

## Real Estate Tech Spans a Broad Range:

- Construction
- Management
- Business Operations
- Brokerage
- Retail
- Banking
- Climate / Energy
- Data

And within those fields, you can probably break down several sub-categories. 

The total value of US commercial real estate is estimated to be between [$14 and $17 trillion dollars](https://www.reit.com/data-research/research/nareit-research/estimating-size-commercial-real-estate-market-us), with [$307 billion in revenue for 2021](https://www.statista.com/outlook/io/real-estate/united-states). It makes sense that companies are racing to find solutions to the sector's problems.

__We all know COVID dominated 2020. Regardless, over $17 billion was poured into proptech, with many companies implementing new technologies to keep operating in this new world.__

## So what does this mean?

The industry is changing, and year over year more companies are entering the sector. Some great advancements over the past few years:

- Data has become more accessible. Municipalities have embraced open data - sharing parcel, assessment and other information that used to be hidden behind a high price tag. Proprietary platforms increasingly have API's, making transfer of information easier.

- Modular and 3D printed properties have popped up across the globe. Pre-fabricated methods are slashing costs and build times compared to traditional methods in many cases.

- The internet of things has become more prevalent, smart devices have changed the way we manage our spaces.

- LiDAR scanners have made their way into our smartphones. Creating 3D models used to require an architect or design professional, now it is within reach of the everyday consumer.

- Listing platforms have grown larger, changing the way buyers, tenants, and owners look for and advertise properties.

- Blockchain has gained more and more adoption. It's only a matter of time before it changes the way real estate is transacted.

__The list goes on. In order to compete, professionals will need to learn and adapt.__
